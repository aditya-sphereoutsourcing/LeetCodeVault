This repository contains solutions to 1000+ LeetCode problems implemented in multiple programming languages. I solve 5 problems daily and commit the solutions to this repository, starting from February 5, 2025.

## Languages

Solutions are implemented in five programming languages:

- C
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, with each solution file following the naming convention:

```
<Language>/<Problem Number>_<Problem Name>.<extension>
```

For example:
- `Python/0001_two_sum.py`
- `C/0146_lru_cache.c`
- `Java/0200_number_of_islands.java`

## Solution Format

Each solution file includes:

1. Problem number and title with LeetCode link
2. Date when the solution was created (starting from February 5, 2025)
3. Detailed problem description
4. Time complexity analysis
5. Space complexity analysis
6. Commented solution code explaining the approach

Example:

```python
"""
LeetCode Problem #1: Two Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Date: February 5, 2025

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Time Complexity: O(n) - We scan through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(n) - We use a hash map to store the values we've seen.
