## Solution Format

When adding or modifying solutions, please follow this format:

### For Python:
```python
"""
LeetCode Problem #XXX: Problem Name
https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-link/

Date: Month Day, Year

Problem Description:
[Include the full problem description here]

Time Complexity: O(?) - [Brief explanation]
Space Complexity: O(?) - [Brief explanation]
"""

class Solution:
    def functionName(self, param1: Type, param2: Type) -> ReturnType:
        # Implementation with comments explaining approach
        pass
```

### For JavaScript:
```javascript
/**
 * LeetCode Problem #XXX: Problem Name
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-link/
 * 
 * Date: Month Day, Year
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * [Include the full problem description here]
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(?) - [Brief explanation]
 * Space Complexity: O(?) - [Brief explanation]
 */

/**
 * @param {Type} param1
 * @param {Type} param2
 * @return {ReturnType}
 */
var functionName = function(param1, param2) {
    // Implementation with comments explaining approach
};
```

### For Java:
```java
/**
 * LeetCode Problem #XXX: Problem Name
