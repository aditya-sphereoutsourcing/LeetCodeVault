LeetCode Problem #84: Largest Rectangle in Histogram
https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/

Date: March 12, 2025

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, 
return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Time Complexity: O(n) - We process each bar exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(n) - In the worst case, all bars are in ascending order, and we push them all onto the stack.
