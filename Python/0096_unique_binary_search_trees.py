LeetCode Problem #96: Unique Binary Search Trees
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/

Date: March 15, 2025

Problem Description:
Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) 
which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - We compute each G(i) exactly once, and each computation takes O(i) time.
Space Complexity: O(n) - We use an array of size n+1 to store the intermediate results.
