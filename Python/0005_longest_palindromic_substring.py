LeetCode Problem #5: Longest Palindromic Substring
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Date: February 7, 2025

Problem Description:
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - For each center, we expand outwards checking for palindromes.
Space Complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra space.
