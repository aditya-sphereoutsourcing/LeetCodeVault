LeetCode Problem #48: Rotate Image
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

Date: February 27, 2025

Problem Description:
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. 
DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - We must touch each element in the n x n matrix.
Space Complexity: O(1) - We perform the rotation in-place without using extra space.
