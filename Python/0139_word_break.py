LeetCode Problem #139: Word Break
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/

Date: March 25, 2025

Problem Description:
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented 
into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - For each starting position, we may need to check substrings of all possible lengths.
Space Complexity: O(n) - We use a dp array of size n+1.
