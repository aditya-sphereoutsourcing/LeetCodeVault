LeetCode Problem #36: Valid Sudoku
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

Date: February 23, 2025

Problem Description:
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated 
according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - We need to traverse the entire 9x9 Sudoku board.
Space Complexity: O(n) - We use hash sets to track used numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box.
